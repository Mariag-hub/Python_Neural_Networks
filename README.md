# Python_Neural_Networks
Some of the projects that we have made during our universuty courses.
The first one is about using a Neural Network to classify images from the dataset fashion_mnist, avaiable on the UCI Machine Learning Repository website. 

1) Progetto.py : Download of the dataset fashion_mnist and normalization.
2) Multi_1.py : Definition through Tensorflow of a Multi Layer Perceptron class (MLP), with a single hidden layer.
3) Alg_S.py : Genetic Algorithm to optimize the hyperparameters of the neural neutwork (number of hidden neurons, minibatch size for training, learning rate).
4) Multi_2.py : Same as Multi_1.py, but with 2 hidden layers.
5) Alg_S.py : Same as Alg_S.py, but with 2 hidden layers.

The modules that are needed to run the code above are Tensorflow, Numpy, Matplotlib, Deap. As of now Tensorflow is only compatible with Python versions <= 3.7.0
